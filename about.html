    A "treasure hunt" is a game where participants follow a series of clues, often in the form of riddles or puzzles, to discover a hidden "treasure," which can be a prize, a specific location, or even just the satisfaction of solving the clues; it involves problem-solving, exploration, and sometimes teamwork to reach the final destination where the treasure is located.</p>
